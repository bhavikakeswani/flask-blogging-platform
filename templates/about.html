        Hi, I’m Bhavika Keswani, a Computer Applications student with a strong interest 
        in coding, web development, and problem-solving through technology. Over time, 
        I’ve explored different areas of programming, from building web applications to 
        experimenting with data-driven projects, and I enjoy the process of learning 
        something new every day.
        </p>
        <p>
        I created this website as a personal space to share my projects, ideas, and 
        experiences—not only as a way to showcase my work but also to document my growth 
        as a developer. Here you’ll find a blend of blogs, experiments, and insights 
        that reflect my journey in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
        My long-term goal is to keep building meaningful projects, gain hands-on 
        experience in the industry, and grow into a role where I can contribute to 
        impactful solutions while continuing to learn and improve.
